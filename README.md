TaskTrek, an AI-powered checklist designed specifically for helping you accomplish your goals. Simply input a certain goal you have, and it will automatically design a planner, along with weekly challenges and suggestions on material that may help.

Currently in heavy beta, expect lots of changes as I develop my vision. 

Currently does not provide any API key for the AI benefit, please make a .config JSON file and specify your own API key there.

## How to use:

1. Download files and unzip
2. Create `config.json` file, insert openAI API key
3. run `checklist.py` in CMD (will create .exe application on 1.0.0 release)
4. Enjoy!
